## Introduction: Why We Did This  

Public restrooms are shared spaces that require proper etiquette and responsibility from everyone. One of the most common yet overlooked courtesies is flushing after use. Our project, **Everyone Flush**, aims to serve as a simple yet effective reminder to encourage proper restroom hygiene.  

By creating a visually appealing and clear sign, we want to promote cleanliness and consideration for others. The design of this poster ensures that the message is both noticeable and easy to understand, using a combination of engaging visuals and well-chosen typography. Through this project, we hope to reinforce good habits in public and private restrooms alike.

## Background  

For the **Everyone Flush** project, we carefully selected design elements to ensure the message is clear, visually appealing, and easy to read. Below are the key design choices we made:  

### **Colors**  
- **Background Color:** `#F1F0E9` (a light beige tone for a clean and neutral look)  
- **Text Color:** `#66D2CE` (a soft cyan that contrasts well with the background)  

### **Typography**  
- **Font Style:** We used *Playwrite IT Moderna* from Google Fonts for a unique and stylish appearance.  
- **Heading Font Size:** `3rem` to make the main message stand out.  
- **Paragraph Font Size:** `1.5rem` for readability.  

### **Layout & Alignment**  
- The **image** is positioned at the **top center** to grab attention.  
- The **heading ("EVERYONE FLUSH")** is centered directly below the image.  
- The **message ("Flush after your business")** is aligned under the heading, maintaining a visually balanced structure.  

This design approach ensures that the message is easy to see and understand while maintaining a clean and professional aesthetic.


## Tools Used  

For the **Everyone Flush** project, we utilized several tools to design, develop, and manage the project efficiently.  

- **HTML & CSS** – Used for structuring and styling the webpage.  
- **VS Code** – Our primary code editor for writing and testing the project.  
- **Google Fonts** – Integrated custom fonts (`Playwrite IT Moderna`) for a unique look.

These tools helped streamline the development process, ensuring a clean and well-structured final product.
